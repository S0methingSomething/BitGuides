# --- HOUSE STYLE DECISIONS ---
# We are prioritizing the Microsoft Style Guide for its user-friendly tone.
# This means we turn off Google's stricter rules where they conflict.

# Use Microsoft's friendlier sentence-case headings instead of Google's title case.
Google.Headings = NO

# Allow contractions (like "don't" instead of "do not") for a more natural tone.
Google.Contractions = NO

# Allow exclamation points for emphasis, which is fine for a game guide.
Google.Exclamation = NO

# Allow the use of "will" for future actions, as it sounds more natural.
Google.Will = NO

# Be more lenient on using first-person ("we", "I"), as Microsoft's guide is.
Google.FirstPerson = NO

# This rule about ellipses (...) is often too noisy.
proselint.Typography = NO
